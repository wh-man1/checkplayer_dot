## CHECK PLAYER DOT

A Telegram bot built with Python that checks if two Dota 2 players have played together in recent games.

How it works:
1. First, give the bot your Steam ID.  
2. Next, give it the other player's Steam ID.  
3. The bot checks if you played together recently.  
   - If you did, it provides stats for both players from those games.
